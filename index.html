	<h1>RDF/XML sucks</h1>
	
	<h2>What's the problem?</h2>
	<p>
		The RDF/XML format. Representing RDF in XML sucks and there are many reasons for that, read below. Luckily there is a solution to it as well: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/" title="RDF/Turtle">RDF/Turtle</a>.
	</p>

	<h2>Why does RDF/XML suck?</h2>
	<p>
		Here is what some relevant people in the community think:

			<p>I think we used to say "It's the Model, stupid" [...] I originally fought hard to make the RDF syntax *not* use XML, because it seemed obvious that most XML tools were not going to be terribly helpful.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>I think it was a mistake to use XML as RDF's syntax. It seems to have created more confusion than good. Early on when designing RDF I advocated an s-expression-based syntax, because it would not be as verbose as XML, it would have been easier to write (really), and most importantly, I didn't think there were any real benefits to using XML. It was not meant to be, though, and eventually I got voted down. [...] XML syntax for RDF is a political design decision, not a technical one.</p>

			<p>RDF has ignored what I consider to be the central lesson of the World Wide Web, the "View Source" lesson. [...] I have never actually managed to write down a chunk of RDF/XML correctly, even when I had the triples laid out quite clearly in my head. Furthermore - once again speaking for myself - I find most existing RDF/XML entirely unreadable. [...] I don't think anyone needs to feel particularly bad about this failed experiment.</p>

			<p>While many syntactic problems have been fixed [in RDF/XML], some of the "postponed issues" indicate the extent of the original mess: e.g. "RDF embedded in XHTML and other XML documents is hard [i.e. impossible] to validate." and "it is not possible to define a subset of RDF/XML that can represent all RDF graphs and can be described by an DTD or an XML Schema".
			In brief, RDF/XML does not layer RDF on top of XML in a useful way.</p>

			<p>I'd be happy if RDF/XML were burned at the stake.</p>
			<p>It takes a deep understanding of RDF to understand why it's powerful and that knowledge isn't being distributed in a way that is good and efficient. Part of the blame is probably because of the RDF/XML serialization format - which is often associated as one and the same with RDF.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>In our TQ training series, we stopped using RDF/XML for pedagogical purposes 3-4 years ago. Having to explain <code>rdf:about</code>, <code>rdf:ID</code>, etc. was such a waste of valuable time, and did little to help trainees understand how semantic technology works and can be utilized. We re-centered the training to focus on the RDF model, as @bobdc suggests, and found this to be much more effective. A mantra I use is "Once you understand that it's all about the triples, the rest will become easier." Turtle represents the triples directly. RDF/XML obfuscates the triples (by necessity of fitting a square peg, tree structures, into a triangular hole, RDF triples).</p>

			<p>RDF/XML got people to confuse the syntax with the semantics. [...] Also RDF/XML is just too difficult for people to understand. It would be much better if all formal documents used the Turlte notation (N3 if graphs are required) to explain things together with graph notations. The simplicity of the concepts are just lost in the RDF/XML notation.
