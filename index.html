			<p>I think it was a mistake to use XML as RDF's syntax. It seems to have created more confusion than good. Early on when designing RDF I advocated an s-expression-based syntax, because it would not be as verbose as XML, it would have been easier to write (really), and most importantly, I didn't think there were any real benefits to using XML. It was not meant to be, though, and eventually I got voted down. […] XML syntax for RDF is a political design decision, not a technical one.</p>

			<p>RDF has ignored what I consider to be the central lesson of the World Wide Web, the “View Source” lesson.

Furthermore—once again speaking for myself—I find most existing RDF/XML entirely unreadable. […] I don't think anyone needs to feel particularly bad about this failed experiment.</p>

			<p>While many syntactic problems have been fixed [in RDF/XML], some of the “postponed issues” indicate the extent of the original mess: e.g. “RDF embedded in XHTML and other XML documents is hard [i.e. impossible] to validate.” and “it is not possible to define a subset of RDF/XML that can represent all RDF graphs and can be described by an DTD or an XML Schema”.</p>
			<p>In brief, RDF/XML does not layer RDF on top of XML in a useful way.</p>

			<p>In our TQ training series, we stopped using RDF/XML for pedagogical purposes 3-4 years ago. Having to explain <code>rdf:about</code>, <code>rdf:ID</code>, etc. was such a waste of valuable time, and did little to help trainees understand how semantic technology works and can be utilized. We re-centered the training to focus on the RDF model, as @bobdc suggests, and found this to be much more effective. A mantra I use is “Once you understand that it's all about the triples, the rest will become easier.” Turtle represents the triples directly. RDF/XML obfuscates the triples (by necessity of fitting a square peg, tree structures, into a triangular hole, RDF triples).</p>
