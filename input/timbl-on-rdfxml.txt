15:09:52	<mhausenblas>	cygri pointed out http://www.lassila.org/blog/archive/2005/05/xml_considered.html today to me
15:10:17	<mhausenblas>	this whole RDF/XML thing threw us back for years, IMHO
15:10:39	<mhausenblas>	with JSON we have something developers can be very productive
15:11:45	<mhausenblas>	I find the overall message: let's base RDF on the XML stack a complete nonsense and wished Ora would have pulled through
...
15:19:01	<timbl>	"this whole RDF/XML thing threw us back for years, IMHO" -- yes, indeed, and Martin Nally made that point forcefully at the workshop on linked enterprise data, that putting your XML mindset on makes you take many years extra, as you are reading everying with XML glasses and just not getting it.
15:19:13	<timbl>	So, he said just use turtle
15:19:17	<timbl>	which I agree with.
...
15:39:18	<bblfish>	because the RDF/XML confuses people
15:39:23	<mhausenblas>	no!
15:39:34	<mhausenblas>	people love it. for breakfast, lunch and dinner
15:39:35	<mhausenblas>	:P
15:39:57	<mhausenblas>	is that cygri behind me on the floor?
15:40:41		* cygri doesn't know what's worse, RDF/XML or mhausenblas' jokes
15:40:49		* cygri runs
15:40:50		* nevali grins
15:40:53	<mhausenblas>	certainly my jokes
15:41:10	<mhausenblas>	you can run, cygri - but not hide. and REST assured, I GET you :P
15:41:17	<bblfish>	:D
15:41:25		* nevali winces
15:41:35		* rszeno try HEAD first
15:41:41	<mhausenblas>	ROTFL
15:41:44	<timbl>	no your jokes are not that bad
15:42:00		* mhausenblas totally forgot how entertaining swig is ;)
15:42:21	<mhausenblas>	thanks timbl, that means much to me (when you say it) ... but you didn't hear my CORS joke from yesterday
15:42:24	<timbl>	compared with rdf/xml ;-)
...
15:42:50	<timbl>	Ok, I reserve judgement and the fish.
